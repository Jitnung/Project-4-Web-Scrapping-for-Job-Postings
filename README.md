TITLE: GA DSI07 Project 4: WEB SCRAPING JOB POSTINGS


SUMMARY: This is my fourth assigned project at General Assembly (Singapore), as part of a 12-week Data Science Immersive course. The project involves scrapping for jobs data on a government jobs bank, and using the data to analyse salary trends and to see if they are predictive of high pay.
